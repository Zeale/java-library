// All other prompt classes should be changed to match this one in that it extends a PromptDialogue whose first type parameter can be a super class of K. If Prompt#getKey() is ever changed from private to public, or event to protected, this will allow prompts to return more specific instances of their keys, since their type parameter can be more specific.
// Subclasses of Prompt can NOT extend PromptDialogue<?, ? super V>.Prompt<V> to simply "drop their key type parameter," because their constructors won't work. They won't be able to ask for a PromptDialogue of the exact types wrapping the Prompt that they extended if they don't cache what the key type is. Still, Prompt subclasses probably shouldn't force the dialogue they are added into to take keys exactly matching their key.
